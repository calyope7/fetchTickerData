Get your API key from alphavantage.co.  Free is limited to 25 requests per day
Open a Google Sheets and Put Tickers as the column header for A1
Put list of Tickers you want to get data about beginning in cell A2
Open Google Apps Script by going to the Extensions tab in the Sheet you are working in.
Delete the place myFunction placeholder and paste code from code.js file in this repo into the window.
Note that there are many more available values that than the 4 that are listed in the array.  
  So, simply go to the url https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&&apikey=yourAPI where the value after symbol= is a ticker (3M in this case) and yourAPI is the key you get when registering with alphavantag.co
  Take a look at all of the values that you want and add the additional fields.  In the below example I am just adding RevenueTTM and marking the new entry with -> for demonstration purposes.  Don't actually use the ->
    // Extract relevant data
  var industry = data["Industry"];
  var sector = data["Sector"];
  var dividendYield = data["DividendYield"];
  var dividendDate = data["DividendDate"];
  -> var revenueTTM = data["RevenueTTM"]
    // Return an array of values
  return [industry, sector, dividendYield, dividendDate, revenueTTM];
Execute your script.  Note that if you have the free APIKey, only the first 25 will have values returned, so it is probably best to start with 1 or 2 tickers while you are putting this together.
